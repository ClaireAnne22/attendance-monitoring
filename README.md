ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
The Attendance System is a web-based SaaS (Software as a Service) application developed using the Laravel . It is designed to streamline the management of student attendance and academic records, providing teachers with a simple, efficient, and secure way to handle essential classroom data.
This user-friendly platform enables educators to perform key administrative functions such as registering accounts, adding and managing subjects and students, and updating personal profiles. Built with Laravelâ€™s powerful features, the system ensures high performance, scalability, and security.
With functionalities like user registration and login, subject and student management, profile updates, password changes, and the ability to edit or delete records, all data is centralized and easily accessible.
